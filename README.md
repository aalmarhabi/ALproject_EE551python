# Simple Long-shot term memory model (LSTM) using Pytorch
LSTM can be think of it as powerfull Recurrent neural network (RNN). In this project we will create our own class for LSTM model. And we will inhernt some methods from pytorch neural networks nn.model. Then finally train it on MNIST dataset.


# Requirement
```
python==3.6
torch==1.0.1.post2
torchvision==0.2.2.post3
```

# How to navigate this repository?
Navigate the project is very simple. You have folder for the datasets and both main code and jupyter notebook are outside.

# Datasets used in this project:
THE MNIST dataset of handwritten digits created by Yann LeCun, Courant Institute, NYUCorinna Cortes, Google Labs, New York Christopher J.C. Burges, Microsoft Research, Redmond. The MNIST database has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html)

# How to run the code?
You can use jupyter notebook to run the code. MNIST datasets will be download using pytorch datsets loader. Or you can run the main.py code using python3 in command line.
